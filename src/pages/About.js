                        David Comerford is the founder/owner and manager of 360 Degree Construction Company.  <span className=' text-red-500'>360 Degree Construction</span> was founded in 2008 as a small remodeling company for personal clients and has grown into a development company
                        with a goal of creating lasting, modern designs that continually evolve to reflect the ever-changing Austin real estate landscape. David went to Llano High School in Llano, Texas. He has a BA in English from the   <span className=' text-red-500'>Universityof Texas at Austin. </span> 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After forming 360 Degree Construction Company in 2008, David worked with many clients, primarily in Central Austin, redesigning and remodeling existing houses with the intent of maintaining the visually integrity of the structure itself
                        while also remaining cohesive with the neighborhood design. 360 Degree Construction then began working with a hard money lender to alleviate their backlog of foreclosures. This is where David gained experience with the potential mistakes
                        and pitfalls that can lead to nonperforming loans. Today, 360 Degree Construction builds imaginative, quality spec homes that reflect the needs of the growing city.
